Example with a Dummy Destination, pg 327
=============================================

The NORTHERN AIRPLANE COMPANY builds commercial airplanes  

+ The last stage of production is to produce the jet engines and then to install them in the completed airplane frame  
+ The company has been working under some contracts to deliver a considerable number of airplanes in the near future  
+ Production of the jet engines for these planes must now be scheduled for the next four months  

+ To meet the contracted dates for delivery, the company must supply engines for installation in the quantities indicated in the second column of the Table 9.7     

+ The cumulative number of engines produced by the end of months 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be at least 10, 25, 50, and 70 

+ Because of the variations in production costs, it may well be worthwhile to produce some of the engines a month or more before they are scheduled for installation  

+ **The drawback is that such engines must be stored until the scheduled installation (the airplane frames will not be ready early) at a storage cost of $15,000 per month**

Incorporate dummy destination for storage
=============================================

+ Furthermore, because the demand for the dummy destination is the total unused capacity, this demand is

+ Storage = Max production (25 + 35 + 30 + 10) - Scheduled installations (10 + 15 + 25 + 20) = 30

+ With this demand included, the sum of the supplies now equals the sum of the demands

Build and solve the model
