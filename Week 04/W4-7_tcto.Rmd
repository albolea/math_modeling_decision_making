Apply network optimization over time, Ch 10.8
=============================================

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

+ Treat different stages in a network as different points in time  

  - We have treated stages as locations (i.e plants, warehouses, etc)  
  - Spatial (distance) optimization with capacity constraints  

+ Task times can be represented as a network  

  - Each node indicates a task that must be accomplished before the next can task can be started  
  - Each edge indicates the time it takes the task to be completed    
  - Network appearance comes from being able to do multiple tasks simultaneously  
    - Tasks are occuring simultaneously and sequetially
  - Creates branches between beginning and end  

+ Text book example of construction

Incorporate multiple criteria into an optimization
=============================================

+ Suppose you need to optimize over more than one criteria of a problem   
    
  - Cost and time  
  - Profit and distance  

+ Units of the objective function must be the same  

  - Cannot sum dollars, time, miles, etc together  

+ How can you optimize over criteria in different units??  

  >- Convert all criteria to a specific unit such as dollars  
  >- Include different criteria in the constraints  


Time-cost trade-off for project as a network
=============================================

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

+ The time-cost problem framework addresses this problem more directly  

  - We will use a simpler example than above  

+ We are interested in the length of each path  

  - A-C-E-F-finish = 12 + 15 + 18 + 6 = 51 days	
  - B-D-finish = 23 + 25 = 48 days  

+	**Critical Path** is the longest path  

    - Represents the project length
        - A-C-E-F-finish is the critical path in this example  
    - If need to reduce the project length must shorten longest path  
        - And possibly all paths

What if want to reduce the time to completion?
=============================================

**Crashing** the project: take costly steps to reduce project duration  

+ Same idea applies to shipping goods (and other network problems)  

+ What is the least-cost way to crash the project?  

    - This is a network optimization problem with multiple objectives  
    - Two ways to model this problem in a linear programming framework  
    1.	Minimize the cost of reducing days  
        -	Decision variables are **reduced days** at a _higher cost_ and **start days**  
        - Have to simultaneously determine reduced days and **new** start dates for activities
            - Why??
            - What does this mean for codding the problem?
        - This is how crashing is presented in text of the chapter  

    2.	Minimize total cost based on a given number of days
        -	Decision variables are **total days** at _crash cost_ and **start days**
        -	This is how crashing is presented text for spreadsheets

Time-cost trade-off project "crash" example
=============================================

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

![](W4_Solved_Ex_10_8.png)

</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">

+ Time: Normal vs Crash project is standard time vs shortest time  

    - Cost: Normal vs Crash is standard vs crash cost  
    - Max day reduction = Normal - Crash time  
    - Crash cost per day = (standard vs crash cost)/(Normal - Crash time)

>+ <span style="color:red; ">Time is being convered to dollars!!</span>    

</div>


How represent this mathematically??
=============================================

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">

+ The original project cost/time calculation is not necessarily an optimization  

    - We will find cost of reducing from the original = $1,860,000

+ Use approach 1: Minimize the cost of reducing days  

**What are the decision variables for the objective function??**  

+ Number of reduced days
  
$$ x_A, \;	x_B, \; x_C, \;	x_D, \;	x_E, \;	and \; x_F $$  

+ New start dates tasks C, D, E and F  
  
$$ y_C,\;	y_D,\;	y_E,\;	and\; y_F $$

How represent this mathematically??
=============================================

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">

**What are the the constraints??**  

+ Maximum of reduced days 
    
$$ x_A\le3, \;	x_B\le5, \; x_C\le 3, \;	x_D\le6, \;	x_E\le4, \;	x_F\le2 $$ 

+ Start dates accounting for new task times and new finish times   

  - Task dates for A to finish  

$$
y_C \; \ge \; (12 - x_A), \\	
y_E \; \ge \; y_C + (15 - x_C),\;	and \\ 
y_F \; \ge \; y_E + (18 - x_E)
$$ 

+ Task dates for B to finish  

$$ 
y_D \; \ge \; (23 - x_B)
$$ 

</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 40%;">


+ Finish for A

$$
y_{Finish} \; \ge \; y_D + (25 - x_D)
$$ 

+ Finish for B

$$
y_{Finish} \; \ge \; y_F + (6 - x_F)
$$ 

</div>


How represent this as a model?
=============================================

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

+ But there is a problem with the way these are written  

  - Some decision variables are on the right hand side of the equations  
  - The equations must not have variables on the RHS!  
    
+ Now it is your turn  

  - Write up the model so it is ready for coding  
  - Decision variables  

$$
x_A, \;	x_B, \; x_C, \;	x_D, \;	x_E, \;	and \; x_F
$$  
$$
y_C,\;	y_D,\;	y_E,\;	and\; y_F
$$

$$
x_A\le3, \;	x_B\le5, \; x_C\le 3, \;	x_D\le6, \;	x_E\le4, \;	x_F\le2
$$ 

$$
y_C \; \ge \; (12 - x_A), \\	
y_E \; \ge \; y_C + (15 - x_C), \\ 
y_F \; \ge \; y_E + (18 - x_E),
$$ 

$$
y_D \; \ge \; (23 - x_B),
$$ 

$$
